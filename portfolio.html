        <h4>Kidney Dissections!</h4> 
        <p>I got to apply my knowledge of the urinary system to the kidney by making transverse cuts and identifying anatomical structures such as the ureter and renal medulla.</p>

        <h4>Pig Dissections!</h4>
        <p>I got to perform several surgical acts such as unwinding both intestines, detaching thoracic organs, and removing the brain. </p>

        <h4>Academic Decathlon!</h4>
        <p>In my 11th grade year of high school, I took part of my school's academic decathlon team. I had to spend hours studying countless pages of facts and fiction surrounding the competition topic: water. I was chosen to be one of three competitors for the regional competition. By the end of the competition, I had competed in seven objective exams such as mathematics and social sciences, performed a impromptu and prepared speech, and executed an interview.</p>

        <h4>Lunar New Year Celebrations!</h4>
        <p>As part of my school's Lunar New Year celebrations, we always plan cultural festivities to include the student body in the holiday. In the 2022 LNY celebration, I helped create the idea of passing out 红包 (red envolopes) with notes and candies to your friends! We also celebrate with a dragon dance :D</p>

          <h4>Girls Who Code!</h4>
          <p>This website is part of the project I am creating from the 'Girls Who Code' summer self-paced program! I learned how to use HTML and CSS coding to formulate the website you're currently so that you can learn more about me and my works.</p>

The title reads 'On the Quest to Survive!' with the date and duration in small lettering beneath. Following the date and duration, are four symbols that give you the option to add the podcast to your playlist, download it, share it, or see more options. The very right of the image is a large green circle with the triangular play button to initiate it's playing. Underneath the symbols is the brief description of what the podcast is about: the trials and tribulations school children face today.">
       <h4>"On the Quest to Survive!" Podcast!</h4>    
       <p>This podcast was a group project that we had to publish as our final exam for my AP Language course. We had to spend weeks researching and working, resulting in a 50-page annotated bibliography and nearly hour-long podcast. While very tedious and exhausting, it was a lot of fun working with my friends and seeing the final product come to life!</p>

        <h4>Wolverine Pantry!</h4>
        <p>As a student council executive member, I played a major part in organizing my school's food pantry. This pantry provides meals to low-income individuals at my school, other local schools, and a nearby church. We have helped feed many individuals and families, especially after the arduous freeze that hit Texas in February 2021.</p>
